NAME
       vcftools v0.1.14 - Utilities for the variant call format (VCF) and binary variant call format (BCF)

SYNOPSIS
       vcftools [ --vcf FILE | --gzvcf FILE | --bcf FILE] [ --out OUTPUT PREFIX ] [ FILTERING OPTIONS ]  [ OUTPUT OPTIONS ]

DESCRIPTION
       vcftools  is  a suite of functions for use on genetic variation data in the form of VCF and BCF files. The tools provided will be
       used mainly to summarize data, run calculations on data, filter out data, and convert data into other useful file formats.

EXAMPLES
       Output allele frequency for all sites in the input vcf file from chromosome 1
         vcftools --gzvcf input_file.vcf.gz --freq --chr 1 --out chr1_analysis

       Output a new vcf file from the input vcf file that removes any indel sites
         vcftools --vcf input_file.vcf --remove-indels --recode --recode-INFO-all --out SNPs_only

       Output file comparing the sites in two vcf files
         vcftools --gzvcf input_file1.vcf.gz --gzdiff input_file2.vcf.gz --diff-site --out in1_v_in2

       Output a new vcf file to standard out without any sites that have a filter tag, then compress it with gzip
         vcftools --gzvcf input_file.vcf.gz --remove-filtered-all --recode --stdout | gzip -c > output_PASS_only.vcf.gz

       Output a Hardy-Weinberg p-value for every site in the bcf file that does not have any missing genotypes
         vcftools --bcf input_file.bcf --hardy --max-missing 1.0 --out output_noMissing

       Output nucleotide diversity at a list of positions
         zcat input_file.vcf.gz | vcftools --vcf - --site-pi --positions SNP_list.txt --out nucleotide_diversity

BASIC OPTIONS
       These options are used to specify the input and output files.

   INPUT FILE OPTIONS
         --vcf <input_filename>
           This option defines the VCF file to be processed. VCFtools expects files in VCF format v4.0, v4.1 or v4.2. The latter two are
           supported  with  some  small limitations. If the user provides a dash character '-' as a file name, the program expects a VCF
           file to be piped in through standard in.

         --gzvcf <input_filename>
           This option can be used in place of the --vcf option to read compressed (gzipped) VCF files directly.

         --bcf <input_filename>
           This option can be used in place of the --vcf option to read BCF2 files directly. You do not need to specify if this file  is
           compressed  with  BGZF encoding. If the user provides a dash character '-' as a file name, the program expects a BCF2 file to
           be piped in through standard in.

   OUTPUT FILE OPTIONS
         --out <output_prefix>
           This option defines the output filename prefix for all files generated by vcftools. For example, if <prefix> is set  to  out-
           put_filename,  then  all  output  files will be of the form output_filename.*** . If this option is omitted, all output files
           will have the prefix "out." in the current working directory.

         --stdout
         -c
           These options direct the vcftools output to standard out so it can be piped into another program or  written  directly  to  a
           filename of choice. However, a select few output functions cannot be written to standard out.

         --temp <temporary_directory>
           This option can be used to redirect any temporary files that vcftools creates into a specified directory.

SITE FILTERING OPTIONS
       These options are used to include or exclude certain sites from any analysis being performed by the program.

   POSITION FILTERING
         --chr <chromosome>
         --not-chr <chromosome>
           Includes  or  excludes  sites with indentifiers matching <chromosome>. These options may be used multiple times to include or
           exclude more than one chromosome.

         --from-bp <integer>
         --to-bp <integer>
           These options specify a lower bound and upper bound for a range of sites to be processed. Sites with positions less  than  or
           greater than these values will be excluded. These options can only be used in conjunction with a single usage of --chr. Using
           one of these does not require use of the other.

         --positions <filename>
         --exclude-positions <filename>
           Include or exclude a set of sites on the basis of a list of positions in a file. Each line of the input file should contain a
           (tab-separated) chromosome and position. The file can have comment lines that start with a "#", they will be ignored.

         --positions-overlap <filename>
         --exclude-positions-overlap <filename>
           Include  or  exclude a set of sites on the basis of the reference allele overlapping with a list of positions in a file. Each
           line of the input file should contain a (tab-separated) chromosome and position. The file can have comment lines  that  start
           with a "#", they will be ignored.

         --bed <filename>
         --exclude-bed <filename>
           Include  or  exclude a set of sites on the basis of a BED file. Only the first three columns (chrom, chromStart and chromEnd)
           are required. The BED file is expected to have a header line. A site will be kept or excluded if any part of any allele  (REF
           or ALT) at a site is within the range of one of the BED entries.

         --thin <integer>
           Thin sites so that no two sites are within the specified distance from one another.

         --mask <filename>
         --invert-mask <filename>
         --mask-min <integer>
           These  options are used to specify a FASTA-like mask file to filter with. The mask file contains a sequence of integer digits
           (between 0 and 9) for each position on a chromosome that specify if a site at that position should be filtered or not.
           An example mask file would look like:
             >1
             0000011111222...
             >2
             2222211111000...
           In this example, sites in the VCF file located within the first 5 bases of the start of chromosome 1 would be  kept,  whereas
           sites at position 6 onwards would be filtered out. And sites after the 11th position on chromosome 2 would be filtered out as
           well.
           The "--invert-mask" option takes the same format mask file as the "--mask" option, however it inverts the  mask  file  before
           filtering with it.
           And the "--mask-min" option specifies a threshold mask value between 0 and 9 to filter positions by. The default threshold is
           0, meaning only sites with that value or lower will be kept.

   SITE ID FILTERING
         --snp <string>
           Include SNP(s) with matching ID (e.g. a dbSNP rsID). This command can be used multiple times in order to  include  more  than
           one SNP.

         --snps <filename>
         --exclude <filename>
           Include  or exclude a list of SNPs given in a file. The file should contain a list of SNP IDs (e.g. dbSNP rsIDs), with one ID
           per line. No header line is expected.

   VARIANT TYPE FILTERING
         --keep-only-indels
         --remove-indels
           Include or exclude sites that contain an indel. For these options "indel" means any variant that alters the length of the REF
           allele.

   FILTER FLAG FILTERING
         --remove-filtered-all
           Removes all sites with a FILTER flag other than PASS.

         --keep-filtered <string>
         --remove-filtered <string>
           Includes or excludes all sites marked with a specific FILTER flag. These options may be used more than once to specify multi-
           ple FILTER flags.

   INFO FIELD FILTERING
         --keep-INFO <string>
         --remove-INFO <string>
           Includes or excludes all sites with a specific INFO flag. These options only filter on the presence of the flag and  not  its
           value. These options can be used multiple times to specify multiple INFO flags.

   ALLELE FILTERING
         --maf <float>
         --max-maf <float>
           Include  only  sites  with  a Minor Allele Frequency greater than or equal to the "--maf" value and less than or equal to the
           "--max-maf" value. One of these options may be used without the other. Allele frequency is defined as the number of times  an
           allele appears over all individuals at that site, divided by the total number of non-missing alleles at that site.

         --non-ref-af <float>
         --max-non-ref-af <float>
         --non-ref-ac <integer>
         --max-non-ref-ac <integer>

         --non-ref-af-any <float>
         --max-non-ref-af-any <float>
         --non-ref-ac-any <integer>
         --max-non-ref-ac-any <integer>
           Include  only  sites  with  all  Non-Reference  (ALT)  Allele Frequencies (af) or Counts (ac) within the range specified, and
           including the specified value. The default options require all alleles to meet the specified criteria,  whereas  the  options
           appended  with  "any" require only one allele to meet the criteria. The Allele frequency is defined as the number of times an
           allele appears over all individuals at that site, divided by the total number of non-missing alleles at that site.

         --mac <integer>
         --max-mac <integer>
           Include only sites with Minor Allele Count greater than or equal to the "--mac" value and less than or equal to  the  "--max-
           mac"  value.  One  of  these  options  may  be used without the other. Allele count is simply the number of times that allele
           appears over all individuals at that site.

         --min-alleles <integer>
         --max-alleles <integer>
           Include only sites with a number of alleles greater than or equal to the "--min-alleles" value and less than or equal to  the
           "--max-alleles" value. One of these options may be used without the other.
           For example, to include only bi-allelic sites, one could use:
             vcftools --vcf file1.vcf --min-alleles 2 --max-alleles 2

   GENOTYPE VALUE FILTERING
         --min-meanDP <float>
         --max-meanDP <float>
           Includes  only sites with mean depth values (over all included individuals) greater than or equal to the "--min-meanDP" value
           and less than or equal to the "--max-meanDP" value. One of these options may be used without the other. These options require
           that the "DP" FORMAT tag is included for each site.

         --hwe <float>
           Assesses sites for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium using an exact test, as defined by Wigginton, Cutler and Abecasis (2005). Sites
           with a p-value below the threshold defined by this option are taken to be out of HWE, and therefore excluded.

         --max-missing <float>
           Exclude sites on the basis of the proportion of missing data (defined to be between 0 and 1, where 0 allows  sites  that  are
           completely missing and 1 indicates no missing data allowed).

         --max-missing-count <integer>
           Exclude sites with more than this number of missing genotypes over all individuals.

         --phased
           Excludes all sites that contain unphased genotypes.

   MISCELLANEOUS FILTERING
         --minQ <float>
           Includes only sites with Quality value above this threshold.

INDIVIDUAL FILTERING OPTIONS
       These options are used to include or exclude certain individuals from any analysis being performed by the program.
         --indv <string>
         --remove-indv <string>
           Specify  an  individual  to  be kept or removed from the analysis. This option can be used multiple times to specify multiple
           individuals. If both options are specified, then the "--indv" option is executed before the "--remove-indv option".

         --keep <filename>
         --remove <filename>
           Provide files containing a list of individuals to either include or exclude in subsequent analysis. Each  individual  ID  (as
           defined  in  the VCF headerline) should be included on a separate line. If both options are used, then the "--keep" option is
           executed before the "--remove" option. When multiple files are provided, the union of individuals from all  keep  files  sub-
           tracted by the union of individuals from all remove files are kept. No header line is expected.

         --max-indv <integer>
           Randomly thins individuals so that only the specified number are retained.

GENOTYPE FILTERING OPTIONS
       These  options  are used to exclude genotypes from any analysis being performed by the program. If excluded, these values will be
       treated as missing.
         --remove-filtered-geno-all
           Excludes all genotypes with a FILTER flag not equal to "." (a missing value) or PASS.

         --remove-filtered-geno <string>
           Excludes genotypes with a specific FILTER flag.

         --minGQ <float>
           Exclude all genotypes with a quality below the threshold specified. This option requires that the "GQ" FORMAT tag  is  speci-
           fied for all sites.

         --minDP <float>
         --maxDP <float>
           Includes  only  genotypes  greater  than  or equal to the "--minDP" value and less than or equal to the "--maxDP" value. This
           option requires that the "DP" FORMAT tag is specified for all sites.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
       These options specify which analyses or conversions to perform on the data that passed through all specified filters.

   OUTPUT ALLELE STATISTICS
         --freq
         --freq2
           Outputs the allele frequency for each site in a file with the suffix ".frq". The second option is used to suppress output  of
           any information about the alleles.

         --counts
         --counts2
           Outputs  the  raw  allele  counts for each site in a file with the suffix ".frq.count". The second option is used to suppress
           output of any information about the alleles.

         --derived
           For use with the previous four frequency and count options only. Re-orders the output file  columns  so  that  the  ancestral
           allele appears first. This option relies on the ancestral allele being specified in the VCF file using the AA tag in the INFO
           field.

   OUTPUT DEPTH STATISTICS
         --depth
           Generates a file containing the mean depth per individual. This file has the suffix ".idepth".

         --site-depth
           Generates a file containing the depth per site summed across all individuals. This output file has the suffix ".ldepth".

         --site-mean-depth
           Generates a file containing the mean depth per site averaged  across  all  individuals.  This  output  file  has  the  suffix
           ".ldepth.mean".

         --geno-depth
           Generates  a (possibly very large) file containing the depth for each genotype in the VCF file. Missing entries are given the
           value -1. The file has the suffix ".gdepth".

   OUTPUT LD STATISTICS
         --hap-r2
           Outputs a file reporting the r2, D, and D' statistics using phased haplotypes. These are the traditional measures of LD often
           reported  in  the  population genetics literature. The output file has the suffix ".hap.ld". This option assumes that the VCF
           input file has phased haplotypes.

         --geno-r2
           Calculates the squared correlation coefficient between genotypes encoded as 0, 1 and 2 to represent the number of  non-refer-
           ence  alleles  in  each  individual.  This  is the same as the LD measure reported by PLINK. The D and D' statistics are only
           available for phased genotypes. The output file has the suffix ".geno.ld".

         --geno-chisq
           If your data contains sites with more than two alleles, then this option can be used to test for  genotype  independence  via
           the chi-squared statistic. The output file has the suffix ".geno.chisq".

         --hap-r2-positions <positions list file>
         --geno-r2-positions <positions list file>
           Outputs  a  file  reporting  the r2 statistics of the sites contained in the provided file verses all other sites. The output
           files have the suffix ".list.hap.ld" or ".list.geno.ld", depending on which option is used.

         --ld-window <integer>
           This optional parameter defines the maximum number of SNPs between the SNPs being tested for LD in the  "--hap-r2",  "--geno-
           r2", and "--geno-chisq" functions.

         --ld-window-bp <integer>
           This  optional parameter defines the maximum number of physical bases between the SNPs being tested for LD in the "--hap-r2",
           "--geno-r2", and "--geno-chisq" functions.

         --ld-window-min <integer>
           This optional parameter defines the minimum number of SNPs between the SNPs being tested for LD in the  "--hap-r2",  "--geno-
           r2", and "--geno-chisq" functions.

         --ld-window-bp-min <integer>
           This  optional parameter defines the minimum number of physical bases between the SNPs being tested for LD in the "--hap-r2",
           "--geno-r2", and "--geno-chisq" functions.

         --min-r2 <float>
           This optional parameter sets a minimum value for r2, below which the LD statistic is not reported by the "--hap-r2", "--geno-
           r2", and "--geno-chisq" functions.

         --interchrom-hap-r2
         --interchrom-geno-r2
           Outputs  a  file  reporting  the  r2 statistics for sites on different chromosomes. The output files have the suffix ".inter-
           chrom.hap.ld" or ".interchrom.geno.ld", depending on the option used.

   OUTPUT TRANSITION/TRANSVERSION STATISTICS
         --TsTv <integer>
           Calculates the Transition / Transversion ratio in bins of size defined by this option. Only uses bi-allelic SNPs. The result-
           ing output file has the suffix ".TsTv".

         --TsTv-summary
           Calculates a simple summary of all Transitions and Transversions. The output file has the suffix ".TsTv.summary".

         --TsTv-by-count
           Calculates  the  Transition  /  Transversion  ratio as a function of alternative allele count. Only uses bi-allelic SNPs. The
           resulting output file has the suffix ".TsTv.count".

         --TsTv-by-qual
           Calculates the Transition / Transversion ratio as a function of SNP quality threshold. Only uses bi-allelic SNPs. The result-
           ing output file has the suffix ".TsTv.qual".

         --FILTER-summary
           Generates  a  summary  of  the number of SNPs and Ts/Tv ratio for each FILTER category. The output file has the suffix ".FIL-
           TER.summary".

   OUTPUT NUCLEOTIDE DIVERGENCE STATISTICS
         --site-pi
           Measures nucleotide divergency on a per-site basis. The output file has the suffix ".sites.pi".

         --window-pi <integer>
         --window-pi-step <integer>
           Measures the nucleotide diversity in windows, with the number provided as the window size. The output  file  has  the  suffix
           ".windowed.pi". The latter is an optional argument used to specify the step size in between windows.

   OUTPUT FST STATISTICS
         --weir-fst-pop <filename>
           This  option  is used to calculate an Fst estimate from Weir and Cockerham's 1984 paper. This is the preferred calculation of
           Fst. The provided file must contain a list of individuals (one individual per line) from the VCF file that correspond to  one
           population.  This  option can be used multiple times to calculate Fst for more than two populations. These files will also be
           included as "--keep" options. By default, calculations are done  on  a  per-site  basis.  The  output  file  has  the  suffix
           ".weir.fst".

         --fst-window-size <integer>
         --fst-window-step <integer>
           These  options  can be used with "--weir-fst-pop" to do the Fst calculations on a windowed basis instead of a per-site basis.
           These arguments specify the desired window size and the desired step size between windows.

   OUTPUT OTHER STATISTICS
         --het
           Calculates a measure of heterozygosity on a per-individual basis. Specfically, the inbreeding coefficient,  F,  is  estimated
           for each individual using a method of moments. The resulting file has the suffix ".het".

         --hardy
           Reports a p-value for each site from a Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test (as defined by Wigginton, Cutler and Abecasis (2005)).
           The resulting file (with suffix ".hwe") also contains the Observed numbers of Homozygotes and Heterozygotes  and  the  corre-
           sponding Expected numbers under HWE.

         --TajimaD <integer>
           Outputs Tajima's D statistic in bins with size of the specified number. The output file has the suffix ".Tajima.D".

         --indv-freq-burden
           This option calculates the number of variants within each individual of a specific frequency. The resulting file has the suf-
           fix ".ifreqburden".

         --LROH
           This option will identify and output Long Runs of Homozygosity. The output file has the  suffix  ".LROH".  This  function  is
           experimental, and will use a lot of memory if applied to large datasets.

         --relatedness
           This  option  is used to calculate and output a relatedness statistic based on the method of Yang et al, Nature Genetics 2010
           (doi:10.1038/ng.608). Specifically, calculate the unadjusted Ajk statistic. Expectation of Ajk is zero for individuals within
           a populations, and one for an individual with themselves. The output file has the suffix ".relatedness".

         --relatedness2
           This option is used to calculate and output a relatedness statistic based on the method of Manichaikul et al., BIOINFORMATICS
           2010 (doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq559). The output file has the suffix ".relatedness2".

         --site-quality
           Generates a file containing the per-site SNP quality, as found in the QUAL column of the VCF file. This file has  the  suffix
           ".lqual".

         --missing-indv
           Generates a file reporting the missingness on a per-individual basis. The file has the suffix ".imiss".

         --missing-site
           Generates a file reporting the missingness on a per-site basis. The file has the suffix ".lmiss".

         --SNPdensity <integer>
           Calculates  the  number  and density of SNPs in bins of size defined by this option. The resulting output file has the suffix
           ".snpden".

         --kept-sites
           Creates a file listing all sites that have been kept after filtering. The file has the suffix ".kept.sites".

         --removed-sites
           Creates a file listing all sites that have been removed after filtering. The file has the suffix ".removed.sites".

         --singletons
           This option will generate a file detailing the location of singletons, and the individual they occur  in.  The  file  reports
           both  true  singletons,  and private doubletons (i.e. SNPs where the minor allele only occurs in a single individual and that
           individual is homozygotic for that allele). The output file has the suffix ".singletons".

         --hist-indel-len
           This option will generate a histogram file of the length of all indels (including SNPs). It shows both the count and the per-
           centage  of  all  indels for indel lengths that occur at least once in the input file. SNPs are considered indels with length
           zero. The output file has the suffix ".indel.hist".

         --hapcount <BED file>
           This option will output the number of unique haplotypes within user specified bins, as defined by the BED  file.  The  output
           file has the suffix ".hapcount".

         --mendel <PED file>
           This  option  is use to report mendel errors identified in trios. The command requires a PLINK-style PED file, with the first
           four columns specifying a family ID, the child ID, the father ID, and the mother ID. The output of this command has the  suf-
           fix ".mendel".

         --extract-FORMAT-info <string>
           Extract  information  from the genotype fields in the VCF file relating to a specfied FORMAT identifier. The resulting output
           file has the suffix ".<FORMAT_ID>.FORMAT". For example, the following command would extract the all of the GT (i.e. Genotype)
           entries:
             vcftools --vcf file1.vcf --extract-FORMAT-info GT

         --get-INFO <string>
           This  option is used to extract information from the INFO field in the VCF file. The <string> argument specifies the INFO tag
           to be extracted, and the option can be used multiple times in order to extract multiple INFO  entries.  The  resulting  file,
           with  suffix  ".INFO", contains the required INFO information in a tab-separated table. For example, to extract the NS and DB
           flags, one would use the command:
             vcftools --vcf file1.vcf --get-INFO NS --get-INFO DB

   OUTPUT VCF FORMAT
         --recode
         --recode-bcf
           These options are used to generate a new file in either VCF or BCF from the input VCF or BCF file after applying the  filter-
           ing options specified by the user. The output file has the suffix ".recode.vcf" or ".recode.bcf". By default, the INFO fields
           are removed from the output file, as the INFO values may be invalidated by the recoding (e.g. the total depth may need to  be
           recalculated  if individuals are removed). This behavior may be overriden by the following options. By default, BCF files are
           written out as BGZF compressed files.

         --recode-INFO <string>
         --recode-INFO-all
           These options can be used with the above recode options to define an INFO key name to keep in the output  file.  This  option
           can be used multiple times to keep more of the INFO fields. The second option is used to keep all INFO values in the original
           file.

         --contigs <string>
           This option can be used in conjuction with the --recode-bcf when the input file does not have any contig  declarations.  This
           option expects a file name with one contig header per line. These lines are included in the output file.

   OUTPUT OTHER FORMATS
         --012
           This  option  outputs  the genotypes as a large matrix. Three files are produced. The first, with suffix ".012", contains the
           genotypes of each individual on a separate line. Genotypes are represented as 0, 1 and 2, where  the  number  represent  that
           number  of  non-reference  alleles. Missing genotypes are represented by -1. The second file, with suffix ".012.indv" details
           the individuals included in the main file. The third file, with suffix ".012.pos" details the site locations included in  the
           main file.

         --IMPUTE
           This  option  outputs  phased  haplotypes in IMPUTE reference-panel format. As IMPUTE requires phased data, using this option
           also implies --phased. Unphased individuals and genotypes are therefore excluded. Only bi-allelic sites are included  in  the
           output.  Using this option generates three files. The IMPUTE haplotype file has the suffix ".impute.hap", and the IMPUTE leg-
           end file has the suffix ".impute.hap.legend". The  third  file,  with  suffix  ".impute.hap.indv",  details  the  individuals
           included in the haplotype file, although this file is not needed by IMPUTE.

         --ldhat
         --ldhelmet
         --ldhat-geno
           These  options  output data in LDhat/LDhelmet format. This option requires the "--chr" filter option to also be used. The two
           first options output phased data only, and therefore also implies "--phased" be used, leading  to  unphased  individuals  and
           genotypes  being excluded. For LDhelmet, only snps will be considered, and therefore it implies "--remove-indels". The second
           option treats all of the data as unphased, and therefore outputs LDhat files in genotype/unphased format.  Two  output  files
           are  generated  with  the  suffixes  ".ldhat.sites" and ".ldhat.locs", which correspond to the LDhat "sites" and "locs" input
           files respectively; for LDhelmet, the two files generated have the suffixes ".ldhelmet.snps" and ".ldhelmet.pos", which  cor-
           responds to the "SNPs" and "positions" files.

         --BEAGLE-GL
         --BEAGLE-PL
           These  options  output genotype likelihood information for input into the BEAGLE program. The VCF file is required to contain
           FORMAT fields with "GL" or "PL" tags, which can generally be output by SNP callers such as  the  GATK.  Use  of  this  option
           requires a chromosome to be specified via the "--chr" option. The resulting output file has the suffix ".BEAGLE.GL" or ".BEA-
           GLE.PL" and contains genotype likelihoods for biallelic sites. This file is suitable for input into BEAGLE  via  the  "like="
           argument.

         --plink
         --plink-tped
         --chrom-map
           These  options  output  the  genotype data in PLINK PED format. With the first option, two files are generated, with suffixes
           ".ped" and ".map". Note that only bi-allelic loci will be output. Further details of these files can be found  in  the  PLINK
           documentation.
           Note:  The  first  option  can be very slow on large datasets. Using the --chr option to divide up the dataset is advised, or
           alternatively use the --plink-tped option which outputs the files in the PLINK transposed format with  suffixes  ".tped"  and
           ".tfam".
           For usage with variant sites in species other than humans, the --chrom-map option may be used to specify a file name that has
           a tab-delimited mapping of chromosome name to a desired integer value with one line per chromosome. This file must contain  a
           mapping for every chromosome value found in the file.

COMPARISON OPTIONS
       These options are used to compare the original variant file to another variant file and output the results. All of the diff func-
       tions require both files to contain the same chromosomes and that the files be sorted in the same order. If one of the files con-
       tains chromosomes that the other file does not, use the --not-chr filter to remove them from the analysis.

   DIFF VCF FILE
         --diff <filename>
         --gzdiff <filename>
         --diff-bcf <filename>
           These  options  compare the original input file to this specified VCF, gzipped VCF, or BCF file. These options must be speci-
           fied with one additional option described below in order to specify what type of comparison is to be performed. See the exam-
           ples section for typical usage.

   DIFF OPTIONS
         --diff-site
           Outputs the sites that are common / unique to each file. The output file has the suffix ".diff.sites_in_files".

         --diff-indv
           Outputs the individuals that are common / unique to each file. The output file has the suffix ".diff.indv_in_files".

         --diff-site-discordance
           This option calculates discordance on a site by site basis. The resulting output file has the suffix ".diff.sites".

         --diff-indv-discordance
           This option calculates discordance on a per-individual basis. The resulting output file has the suffix ".diff.indv".

         --diff-indv-map <filename>
           This option allows the user to specify a mapping of individual IDs in the second file to those in the first file. The program
           expects the file to contain a tab-delimited line containing an individual's name in file one followed by that  same  individ-
           ual's name in file two with one mapping per line.

         --diff-discordance-matrix
           This  option  calculates  a  discordance  matrix.  This option only works with bi-allelic loci with matching alleles that are
           present in both files. The resulting output file has the suffix ".diff.discordance.matrix".

         --diff-switch-error
           This option calculates phasing errors (specifically "switch errors"). This option creates an output  file  describing  switch
           errors found between sites, with suffix ".diff.switch".
